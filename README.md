Flappy Bird Wonder is a common flappy bird clone, but with a Mario Wonder inspired twist. This small project is the accumulated result of a couple spare hours where I got nothing better to do.

The game starts out as the flappy bird we all know and love, but every now and then you can encounter a wonder pipe, which lead you to one of the wonderlevels that put a truly wonderful spin on the classic formula. You might suddenly be in space, control the pipes instead of the bird or be traped in a bouncy cage.
